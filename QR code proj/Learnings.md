## My process

- I started looking at the design and trying to build the project trial by error until its good.
- First, I started constructing the HTML.
- Second, I will then design it using CSS until it matched the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./images/favicon-32x32.png">
```
```css
.centering {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```
