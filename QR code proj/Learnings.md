## Overview

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

- Live Site URL: [Add live site URL here](https://my-project-two-gilt.vercel.app/)

## My process

- I started looking at the design and trying to build the project inside my head. Like what HTML and CSS I would do.
- First, I started constructing the HTML.
- Second, I will then design it using CSS until it matched the design.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

```html
<link rel="icon" type="image/png" sizes="32x32" href="./images/favicon-32x32.png">
```
```css
.center {
  position: absolute;
  top: 50%;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translate(-50%, -50%);
}
```
